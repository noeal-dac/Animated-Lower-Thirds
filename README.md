## Description
With this tool you can use a control panel to add and change your own lower thirds on the fly. Feel free to customize. Basic knowledge of HTML, Javascript and CSS is required.
For communication between control panel and browser layer it use BroadcastChannel API.

This project is based on [Lower thirds in HTML/CSS](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/lower-thirds-in-html-css.928/), and [Animated lower thirds with control panel](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/animated-lower-thirds-with-control-panel.922/).

### Requiriments 
Unfortunately, OBS doesn't support browser panels on MacOs. It only works on Windows, but can be used on Linux using the snap installation of OBS (More info [here](https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/installation-from-snap-26-1-2-35-gbb6b1e53f-with-most-of-the-plugins-and-features.137672/))

## Contributing
I am a designer and my scripting knowledge is few. I made this tool (Frankenststool) because I needed it and I want to share it. You are welcome to improve it. I am aware that many parts of the code can make any expert cry. I'm really sorry :P
